I am an economist who specializes in econometric methods for the analysis of longitudinal micro data and the computational and empirical analysis of industrial organization, insurance markets, and labor markets. At Tilburg University, I engage with faculty and students with similar interests in the [Structural Econometrics Group](https://www.tilburgeconomics.nl/seg).

I am teaching economics at Tilburg University. I taught before at the University of Amsterdam, VU University Amsterdam, the University of Chicago, University College London, the ENSAE in Malakoff (Paris), Tinbergen Institute, the CIdE Summer School of Econometrics (Bertinoro, Italy), the Danish Graduate Programme in Economics (Aarhus, Denmark), Yale University, the Finnish Doctoral Programme in Economics (Helsinki, Finland), the Toulouse School of Economics, and the Econometric Society (Sargan Lectures).

One of my hobbies is to pretend I am 25 years old and [make noise](https://blauwedinsdag.com).
