I am an economist who specializes in the econometrics of dynamic choices and games and the computational and empirical analysis of industrial organization, insurance markets, and labor markets. At Tilburg University, I engage with faculty and students with similar interests in the [Structural Econometrics Group](https://www.tilburgeconomics.nl/seg).

I am a Professor of Econometrics. I have been at Tilburg University since 2008. Before that, I worked at VU Amsterdam, the University of Chicago, and University College London. I am a Research Fellow of CEPR and a Fellow of the IAAE and the Econometric Society. I am a Member of the Royal Holland Society of Sciences and Humanities.

I have [published](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T3nRoZ8AAAAJ&hl=nl&inst=3385539784813856853&oi=ao) in _Econometrica_, _JRSSB_, _Annual Review of Economics_, the _Handbook of Econometrics_, _JEEA_, _JBES_, _Economic Journal_, and other outlets. My current research includes work on dynamic oligopoly, structural duration models, time preferences, student tracking, pharmaceutical R&D, and firm growth and survival.  

I am currently teaching courses in Dynamic Economic Models (MSc) and Empirical Industrial Organization (RM/PhD) and advising five PhD students. I also regularly supervise MSc and BSc thesis research. 

I am the Managing Editor of [_The Econometrics Journal_](https://res.org.uk/journals/the-econometrics-journal/). 

[Curriculum vitae](cv.pdf)

I live in Amsterdam with my wife Barbara, daughter Hanne (2003), and son Bram (2005). I have been in a [band](https://blauwedinsdag.com) since 1991. After some persistent nudging, Spotify recently recognized us as "artists".
